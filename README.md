## Status
Freelance is still in early development stages and is not yet functional.

## Description
Freelance is a tool developed as a case study final project for the Per Scholas Full-Stack Java Developer course.
Freelance will enable users to create entries for each of their clients, and to create entries for all work done for each client.
This will enable users to keep track of the hours they worked for each client and how much to charge their clients for work completed.
Freelance will also serve as a database for clients' contact information and any other notes the user wishes to add.
